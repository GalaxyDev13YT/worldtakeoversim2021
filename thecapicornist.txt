galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 10:59 PM

Val — 8/29/2025 10:59 PM

galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:00 PM

Val — 8/29/2025 11:00 PM
I’m sorry :(
galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:00 PM

too
so now they are gone too
Val — 8/29/2025 11:00 PM
Oh

Imma beat his ass where tf he at
I’m so sorry to hear that
Is there anyway I could help?

galaxydev

galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:06 PM
don't worry its not your problem
Val — 8/29/2025 11:06 PM
Yeah but ur my friend so it is MY problem
galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:07 PM
No it was connor who made all my friends hate me
you dont have to do anything
Val — 8/29/2025 11:07 PM
Ok then…
Why would all ur friends just believe him?
What did he tell them if I may ask
galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:09 PM
Idk I think its about how I made another random "friend" want to die
which
I did not do
Val — 8/29/2025 11:09 PM
That’s horrible
Why would he even do that?
You’ve had your fair share of horrible friends I feel terrible for you joe do you always become friends with these ppl?
galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:10 PM
I though they were better than that
but they all believed him in a heartbeat
so what happened
was I connor and me were in pre engineering and he was joking about signing the "friend" up to the us military because he is a tank and plane nerd and he actually when on the website it was just a joke but I told that "friend" anyway and he overreacted and got mad at connor and then connor called him... some things and he got even madder at connor and said the thing about him wanting to die and connor blamed it all on me and got everyone else to listen to him
this happened on thursday
Val — 8/29/2025 11:13 PM
Oh
Who was it that said that?
galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:13 PM
luke he goes to connors old school
Val — 8/29/2025 11:13 PM
Hmm
Why can’t you ask luke to tell everyone the truth
galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:14 PM
OH
because
it gets even worse
thats the good news
Val — 8/29/2025 11:14 PM
How?
galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:14 PM
basically
it turns out luke was only friends with me to get back at connor
because connor stole lots of games and stuff from him
Val — 8/29/2025 11:15 PM
Why? Isn’t Connor rich?
So Luke won’t clarify will he?
galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:15 PM
No he just tries to got on the good side of both of us
making editing memes to say mean stuff about connor and me 
Val — 8/29/2025 11:16 PM
Oh…
galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:16 PM
then sending the mean memes to me about connor and the memes about me to connor
Val — 8/29/2025 11:16 PM
Safe school report?
Report to councilors
galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:17 PM
Its not worth it did not happen at school
and connor will just deny it anyway
Val — 8/29/2025 11:17 PM
Well do you have any proof?
galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:17 PM
oh thats the worst part
connor and luke blocked me and deleted all evidence
im just going to restart find new friends
because all of my old ones hate me now
there is nothing I can do
Val — 8/29/2025 11:19 PM

galaxydev

Val — 8/29/2025 11:21 PM

galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:21 PM
he won't his ego is too high
I dont want to have to do that stuff again
Val — 8/29/2025 11:21 PM
Well the councilors can still help just go for a lil talk
galaxydev

 — 8/29/2025 11:22 PM
because it just makes it worse
trust me
it did not work in the past
it only works short term
Val — 8/29/2025 11:22 PM

galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:00 PM

Val — 10/4/2025 7:00 PM

galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:00 PM

Val — 10/4/2025 7:01 PM
No, why would I ever be mad at you? What made you think that?
galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:01 PM
because of this question
Val — 10/4/2025 7:01 PM
No matter what I could never be upset with you Colin you’ve been one of my best friends for like forever
galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:02 PM

galaxydev

Val — 10/4/2025 7:02 PM

galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:02 PM
were you avoiding me at the wolveine night?
Val — 10/4/2025 7:02 PM
No I wasn’t. I’m sorry if it seemed like that to you.
Stormies really pushy and stuff and I didn’t want her to get mad if I left her or something you know how she is.
galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:03 PM
yeah ig
Val — 10/4/2025 7:03 PM
Sorry I made you feel that way
galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:03 PM
stormie hates me so makes sense
Val — 10/4/2025 7:04 PM
She doesn’t hate you
galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:04 PM
are you sure I think she does
Val — 10/4/2025 7:04 PM
She just has a very tight knit friend circle for her own personal reasons
galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:04 PM
still think she hates me lol.
Val — 10/4/2025 7:05 PM
She doesn’t she’s like that with everybody except Calleigh and me
She’s like that for her own reasons but it doesn’t mean she hates you alright?
galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:05 PM
ok.
Val — 10/4/2025 7:05 PM
Also don’t bring this up to her either okay? She’ll be upset with me.

Val — 10/4/2025 7:44 PM
That’s valid. One of the only time I agree with Kya
galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:44 PM

asdsasssssdadsadsasdsasssdsasd
Val — 10/4/2025 7:45 PM
I suppose but if she vapes and all that stuff I still don’t want to be associated with her or her crowd
galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:45 PM
but if I were to join her crowd what would that mean?
Val — 10/4/2025 7:46 PM

Val — 10/4/2025 7:58 PM
Listen having kids at a young age is just stupid. It’s a poor financial decision it’s childish and stupid-
And they have multiple kids that’s how you know it wasn’t an accident
No doubt Kya gonna be the same way tbh
Anyways sorry for being rude and stuff
galaxydev

 — 10/4/2025 7:59 PM
