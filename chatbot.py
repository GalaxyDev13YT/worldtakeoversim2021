"""
Interactive chatbot CLI to talk to either persona.

Behavior:
- Loads models from a models dir (produced by train.py).
- For each user input:
  - Detect some names/entities (very simple).
  - If 'kya' is in the message (case-insensitive), apply persona-specific override replies.
  - Else: use TF-IDF + NearestNeighbors to find similar utterances from the persona's corpus.
    - If similarity is high (cosine distance low) return the retrieved utterance (stylized).
    - Otherwise, fall back to Markov generation using the persona's Markov chain.
